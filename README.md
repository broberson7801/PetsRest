# PetsRest

This is a basic API that allows you to create a pet, update a pet, delete a pet and see a particular pet. This API will also take the total number of pets, multiply it by 1270 to give a total cost.

As of this update, after any creation, update, or delete, the page will have to be refreshed to see the changes updated on the API.

Due to serious time constraints, this program cannot look any prettier on the front end.
